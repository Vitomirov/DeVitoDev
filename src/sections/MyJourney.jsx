                I started coding out of curiosity, experimenting with ideas in
                the console just to see them work. But I realized I wanted more.
                I wanted to see my creations online, fully interactive,
                something tangible that people could actually use. That
                curiosity led me to dive into full-stack development, learning
                both frontend and backend to turn ideas into complete,
                real-world products.

                Along the way, my work in market research and mortgage loan
                processing showed me firsthand how inefficient some systems can
                be. Instead of just accepting them, I wanted to build better
                solutions. That drive is what made me fully commit to web
                developmentâ€”and today, creating efficient, user-friendly
                applications is what excites me every day.

                I love turning ideas into visible, usable products. Seeing a
                concept evolve from a simple thought into a fully functional
                application is what motivates me every day as a developer.
